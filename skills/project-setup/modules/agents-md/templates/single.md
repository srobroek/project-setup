## Agent Guidance

<!-- CODEX/AGENTS GUIDANCE: to be filled by agent -->

## AGENTS Layering

- This root `AGENTS.md` applies to the whole repository unless a deeper file overrides it.
- Put repo-wide workflow, architecture, tool, and source-of-truth guidance here.
- Add nested `AGENTS.md` files only for subtrees that need materially different rules.
- Prefer subtree placement over invented path metadata.

## Codex Project Settings

- Project and subfolder Codex overrides live in `.codex/config.toml`.
- MCP servers for this repo or subtree should be declared under `mcp_servers.<name>` in `.codex/config.toml`.
- Keep repo-specific Codex settings here and leave user-global defaults in `~/.codex/config.toml`.
